# Day 3 of RISC-V Design: Essential Training

This repository contains various TL-verilog files that were designed as part of an onramp for the RISC-V Design course offered by [VSD](https://vlsisystemdesign.com) and [Redwood EDA](https://www.redwoodeda.com)

| 1 | Combinatorial Calculator | This is a simple combinatorial calculator that supports addition, subtraction, division and multiplication of 32 bit operands. |  |
| 2 | Fibonacci Sequence Generator  | This shows a 32 bit Fibonacci Sequence generator |  |
| 3 | 32-Bit Counter| A simple 32 bit up counter |  |
| 4 | Sequential Calculator | This is an implementation of the simple calculator with sequential logic and output feedback| |
| 5 | Pythagoras's Theorem | Pipelined logic to calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle| https://makerchip.com/sandbox/0ADf9hQRW/0X6hXjN |
| 6 | Pipeline Error Detector| Compiles various errors that can occur at different stages of a pipeline | https://makerchip.com/sandbox/0ADf9hQRW/01jhMx4 |
